                <h3>Problem description:</h3>
                <p>
By far the most lucrative venue for on-line
advertising has been search, and much of the eectiveness of search advertising comes from
the \AdWords" model of matching search queries to advertisements. For this project, you
need to use Java to access an Oracle database and accomplish an on-line ads auction system
using various bidding algorithms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are going to consider on-line algorithms for solving the AdWords problem, which is
dened as follows. Given:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A set of bids by advertisers for search queries;</li>
                    <li>A click-through rate for each advertiser-query pair;</li>
                    <li>A budget for each advertiser;</li>
                    <li>A limit on the number of ads to be displayed with each search query.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                     Respond to each search query with a set of advertisers such that:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The size of the set is no larger than the limit on the number of ads per query.</li>
                    <li>Each advertiser has bid on the search query.</li>
                    <li>Each advertiser has enough budget left to pay for the ad if it is clicked upon.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The data set consists of three database tables: (primary keys are underlined)
                </p>
                <pre>
                     <strong>Queries</strong>(qid:INTEGER, query:VARCHAR(400))
                     <strong>Advertisers</strong>(advertiserId:INTEGER, budget:FLOAT, ctc:FLOAT)
                     <strong>Keywords</strong>(advertiserId:INTEGER, keyword:VARCHAR(100), bid:FLOAT)</pre>
                <h4>On-line Auction Algorithms to the AdWords Problem
                    <small>One advertiser bid one query i the bid > 0 else the advertiser will not go into the auction
process. Assuming that only K ads can be displayed for each query. It is also possible that
the K slots are not fullled if there are not enough advertiser to bid the query.</small>
                </h4>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>The Greedy Algorithm<small>For each query, the greedy algorithm picks advertisers who has the highest bid for it. The
Top-K advertisers who bid the query and have the highest bids will be shown.</small></li>
                    <li>The Balance Algorithm<small>There is a simple improvement to the greedy algorithm. This algorithm, called the Balance
Algorithm, assigns a query to the Top-K advertisers who bid on the query and have the
largest remaining budgets.</small></li>
                    <li>The Generalized Balance Algorithm<small>Suppose that a query q arrives, advertiser Ai has bid xi for this query (note that xi could
be 0). Also, suppose that fraction fi of the budget of Ai is currently unspent. Let Si =
xi(1-e<sup>-fi</sup> ). Then assign q to the Top-K advertisers who bid the query and have the highest Si.</small></li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Charging Advertisers for Clicks:<small>The advertiser will be charged i the ads was clicked.</small>
                </h4>
                <dl>
                    <dt>1. first-price auction:</dt>
                    <dd>-- when a user clicks on an advertiser's ad, the advertiser is charged the
amount they bid. This policy is known as a rst-price auction.</dd>
                    <dt>2. second-price auction</dt>
                    <dd>-- In reality, search engines use a more complicated system known as
a second-price auction. An advertiser for a search will pay the bid of the next highest bid
advertiser who bid the query . If the advertiser's bid itself is the smallest, it will pay the
price it bids in this case. It has been shown that second-price auctions are less susceptible
to being gamed by advertisers than rst-price auctions and lead to higher revenues for the
search engine.</dd>
                </dl>
                <h4>Task</h4>
                <p>There are 6 tasks you need to nish in this project:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>first price auction and the greedy algorithm.</li>
                    <li>first price auction and the balance algorithm.</li>
                    <li>first price auction and the generalized balance algorithm.</li>
                     <li>second price auction and the greedy algorithm.</li>
                     <li>second price auction and the balance algorithm.</li>
                     <li>second price auction and the generalized balance algorithm.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Improvement</h3>
            <p>After dropping the trigger, the performance of new implementation is better than original one.
               The main improvement is due to dropping the trigger. Because trigger inefficient during executing the sql queries.
               I have tried to create index on the qid or advertiser id on some tables but it didnâ€™t work. Maybe it is because I loop one query every time and all the computation is for one query. 
               I also tried making some changes in the sql queries, but the improvement almost can be ignored .
            </p>
